ðŸ”© It engineered as a plugin. It designed to be added at any time during the development process, even for separate complicated project parts.

**Essence**

It is a slightly different concept from _state management._

Routeshub collects and analyzes routes information to create a manageable state of routes_._ You can understand this concept as a **hub**.
